BOOBSTRAP is a scripts complex to for create bootable GNU/Linux images.

Just take 3 (three) simple steps and you get own bootable GNU/Linux distro!
And then you can boot via network (PXE) or CDROM / USB (bootable ISO).

Written on pure POSIX shell. Confirmed by "Dash".

Personal I living in tmpfs forever.
On all my servers and desktops.

Thats cool -- your system in tmpfs.
Thats fast -- tmpfs is mean RAM.
Thats secure -- if your system breaks just push "RESET" button.
Thats no backup -- backup only your data, not a system.

When my system breaks, or anybody does "rm -rf /", I just push "RESET" button,
and then system boots again via PXE or from USB-flash (ISO).


Software included:

	* mkbootstrap -- Install "chroot" with any distro.

	* mkinitramfs -- Create initrd / initramfs image.

	* mkbootisofs -- Create bootable ISO from directory.

Requirements:

	cpio
	grub
	grub-efi
	dosfstools
	squashfs-tools (optional)
	xorriso

If you want to use SquashFS / OverlayFS, then in your kernel the following
options must be enabled:

CONFIG_OVERLAY_FS=y

and

CONFIG_SQUASHFS=y
CONFIG_SQUASHFS_XZ=y

But. You can just use tmpfs if you have enough RAM for your system, really
doesnt matter. For example, Personal I use GNU/Linux on my home PC-router
running in tmpfs with only 2GB RAM. And feel good.
